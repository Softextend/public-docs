= Romanian Localization Privacy Policy

The Soft Extend Romanian Localization for Business Central consists of a number of BC extensions that together provide the full feature set.
All the data stored and handled by the extensions is stored within the confines of the Business Central instance they run on, with the exceptions noted below.
For cloud environments that means that all the data is stored and accessed according to the limitations, rulesets and permissions set by tennant administrators.

== Communications with external services

In order for some of the features to work as expected (e.g: electronic invoicing), our extensions need to be given permission to send data to externals services.
These services are limited to govenment-managed APIs, and ,if so configured, email services (e.g: sending customized invoice PDFs alongside the official ones).
